<div>
<p>Discount offers define rules for applying discounts to charges, such as apply a 50% discount to the first six months of a newspaper subscription or provide the first 500 minutes of a service for free.</p>
<p>Discount offers allow you to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Reduce charges, such as by 10%, $20, or $10 for every $100 spent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track usage or spending by using counters. You can then discount a charge based on the value of the counter. For example, a discount can track usage and apply a 25% discount to a charge when over 1,000 minutes have been used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consume an allowance, such as minutes or gigabytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credit balances, such as one free download for every fifth song downloaded.</p>

<div>
<p>A charge can be eligible for multiple discount offers. When this occurs, Oracle Monetization Cloud uses the discount offer priority and charging mode to determine how to apply the discount offers to the charge.</p>
<p>The priority specifies the order in which discount offers are applied, with a higher number indicating a higher priority. For example, if a customer has two discount offers, offer A with priority 10 and offer B with priority 8, offer A is applied first and offer B is applied second.</p>
<p>The charging mode specifies whether discounts are applied to an entire charge, to the remaining charge after previous discounts have been applied, or to the portion of a charge that hasn't been considered for a discount.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Original charge:</span> The discount offer is applied to the original charge amount, regardless of whether that amount was reduced by previous discount offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">The remaining charge:</span> The discount offer is applied to whatever charge amount remains after previous discount offers are applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">The remaining charge and quantity:</span> The discount offer is applied only to the part of the charge and quantity that hasn't been used as the basis for a previous discount offer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if a bundle includes discount offer A for 10% off and discount offer B for 20% off, a $50 charge would receive these discounts based on the charging mode:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Using the original charge:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Discount offer A: 10% off of $50 = $5 discount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discount offer B: 20% off of $50 = $10 discount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total discount = $15</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the remaining charge:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Discount offer A: 10% off of $50 = $5 discount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discount offer B: 20% off of $45 = $9 discount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total discount = $14</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the remaining charge and quantity:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Discount offer A: 10% off of $50 = $5 discount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discount offer B: A discount isn't applied because the entire charge was already discounted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total discount = $5</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p>Discount offers can include one or more of these discount types, which correspond to charge types:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Recurring discounts:</span> Discounts that aren't generated or affected by usage, such as a monthly discount. For example, you could offer 10% off of a monthly movie rental for the first year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">One-time discounts:</span> Discounts for product purchases or for non-recurring, limited time promotions. For example, you could offer $25 off the registration fee for customers who join during the month of February.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Billing-time discounts:</span> Discounts that are applied during the billing process and are based on the customer's total usage or amount spent for the billing period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Usage discounts:</span> Discounts that are applied when customers use their services, such as when making phone calls or using the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Allowance:</span> Discounts a charge if there's an available allowance. For example, if a customer has been charged $7 for a movie, but has 3 movies remaining from their allowance of 5 movies per month, the allowance discount credits the $7 charge and reduces the movie allowance by 1.</p>

<div>
<p>Temporary balance elements retain their balance when processing the discounts for one event and then are reset to 0. This allows you to calculate a value in one discount and use it in a subsequent discount. For example, you could grant customers 10 additional minutes of WiFi usage when a session lasts at least 60 minutes and the data transferred is less than 100 megabytes. To do this, you'd create these discounts:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>The first discount determines the amount of data transferred during the session and stores it in temporary balance A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second discount determines the session's duration and stores it in temporary balance B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third discount grants 10 minutes of WiFi usage when the amount in temporary balance A is less than 100 megabytes and the amount in temporary balance B is 60 minutes or higher.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You create temporary balances by using Business Configuration. See <a href="creating-pricing-setup-components1.htm#GUID-B287450B-9222-4738-94AD-B90585D32E13">Creating balance elements</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>The amount used by the customer, such as the number of minutes or gigabytes. For example, you can apply a $10 discount for up to 100 minutes, and a $15 discount $15 for 101 minutes or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount your customer was charged for the event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To do so, select the <span class="bold">Add Quantity Range</span> icon in the discount.</p>
<div class="figure" id="GUID-3E8A836F-30B3-40BB-8738-6B5278AC060B__GUID-6A908E1D-0DD6-4057-A2EF-F5AB63500DBC"><br />

<br /></div>
<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>Enter an ending point for the range. For example, to create a range of 0&ndash;10, enter <span class="bold">10</span>. Each subsequent range uses the end of the previous range as its starting value.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>The end of the range is inclusive. For example, a range of 0&ndash;100 includes minute 100. The next range, 100&ndash;200 minutes, begins at 101.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the first range, you can enter a minimum amount after creating the range. Select the <span class="bold">Quantity Range</span> value and change the <span class="bold">Start</span> value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the last range, you can enter a maximum amount after creating the range. Select the <span class="bold">Quantity Range</span> value and enter an <span class="bold">End</span> value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the ranges, you specify the volume discount settings. The quantity range can represent:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Balance:</span> For example, if the quantity is based on a counter balance of Loyalty Points, the discount applies to counter balances of up to 10 Loyalty Points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Quantity:</span> For example, if the quantity is based on minutes for a range of 0&ndash;10, the discount applies to the first 10 minutes used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Charge:</span> For example, if the quantity is based on dollars for a range of 0&ndash;10, the discount applies to the first 10 dollars charged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You also specify how to apply the discount for the range:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Single:</span> Even though multiple discounts are configured, only one discount is applied, and it's applied to all usage. The range that the total usage falls within determines which discount is applied. For example, consider this scenario:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>0&ndash;500 minutes: 5% off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>500&ndash;No maximum minutes: 10% off</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If 700 minutes are used, the 10% discount is applied to all minutes, even those between 0 and 500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Tiered:</span> The discount for each range is applied. Using the previous example, if 700 minutes are used, the discounts are applied as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>0&ndash;500: A 5% discount is applied to the charge for minutes 1 through 500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>500&ndash;no maximum: A 10% discount is applied to the charge for minutes 501 through 700.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This figure shows a tiered discount based on the amount the customer is charged for usage. A 5% discount is applied to the first $100, and a 10% discount to any remaining charge.</p>

<h2 id="BCSUG-GUID-F4E30565-2FDA-4C05-B1B9-943D9AD4220F" class="sect2">Adding counters to track balances</h2>
<div>
<p>You can add counters to your discounts to track balances such as the amount spent or megabytes downloaded by a customer. Counters allow you to vary discounts based on a counter's total. For example, you could create a counter to track how many books were purchased in a cycle and then grant a discount when the counter total is 5 or more.</p>
<p>To add a counter, do the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>In <span class="bold">Add Counter Type</span>, select the type of counter you want:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Fixed:</span> The counter increments by a fixed amount, such as 1 point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Scaled:</span> The amount the counter increments is dependent on a formula, such as 1 point for every $5 charge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Select whether to increase or decrease the counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the amount to increase or decrease the counter, such as 1 loyalty point, 2 tokens, or 1 point for every $10 charge.</p>
<p>Only noncurrency balance elements that are enabled as counters are supported. See Creating balance elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the number of cycles to keep a running total in the counter: for the current billing cycle, for multiple billing cycles, or always. When the cycle ends, the counter is reset to 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the GL ID to associate with the counter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This figure shows a monthly cycle discount that adds 10 Loyalty Points to the customer's counter balance. The counter keeps a running total indefinitely.</p>

<div>
<p>You can limit when discounts are applied and counters are incremented based on a charge's attributes. The criteria can be based on one or more attribute values, such as the date when the event occurred or a balance element. For example, you can specify that only movies with a New Release category and purchased in June can receive a discount and increment the counter.</p>
<p>To include eligibility criteria, you must add one or more filters to your discount. If you add multiple filters, the charge must meet the criteria in all of the filters.</p>
<p>In the discount, select <span class="bold">Eligibility criteria</span>, select the add icon, and then do the following for each filter:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Enter a name and description for the filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the dates during which the event must have occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Select a balance element, such as euros or free minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a charge selector result tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a charge offer.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can add conditions that a charge must meet in order to apply a discount and increment a counter. For example, you can add a condition that only charges greater than $5 or calls longer than 5 minutes can receive a discount and increment the counter.</p>
<p>To include trigger conditions, select <span class="bold">Trigger conditions</span> in the discount and then do the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Enter a name and description for the trigger condition.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>The expression value, such as balance, quantity, or charge.</p>

<p>Allowance discounts let you credit charges when customers have a remaining allowance of free minutes, books, movies, and so on.
