	<p>Once the desired method is selected, its corresponding REST service status is displayed in the Service Status field. </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
	<p><B>Ready to Use</B> </p>
	<p>This indicates that the selected method is deployed as a REST service operation and it is ready to use in your integration. </p>
  </li><li>
	<p><B>Not Deployed</B></p>
	<p>If the selected method is not deployed as a REST service operation, then "Not Deployed" is shown as the service status instead. A warning message also appears, indicating that you must deploy the method as a REST service operation first before using it in your integration. </p>

	<p>To deploy the selected method as a REST service operation, you need to log in to Oracle E-Business Suite as a user who has the Integration Administrator role. Select the <B>Integrated SOA Gateway</B> responsibility and the <B>Integration Repository</B> link from the navigation menu. Search and locate the selected interface from the Integration Repository, and then deploy it as a REST service. Only when the REST service is available in Oracle E-Business Suite, you can proceed and complete the process of adding Oracle E-Business Suite as an invoke (target) connection. </p>
	<p>For information on deploying REST services, see Deploying REST Web Services, Administering Native Integration Interfaces and Services chapter, <I>Oracle E-Business Suite Integrated SOA Gateway Implementation Guide</I>. </p></li></ul>

	<p>Click <B>Next</B>. </p>
  </li><li>
	<p>The Summary page appears with the selected interface information. The Oracle E-Business Suite Adapter Target Endpoint configuration is successfully created.</p>
	<p>Click <B>Done</B>. </p>
	<p>The connection for Oracle E-Businses Suite now appears in the Invoke (Target) area on the canvas.</p></li></ol>

	<p>Once the Oracle E-Businses Suite invoke (target) connection is created, you can add an application adapter as a trigger (source) connection to complete your integration creation. For information on adding a trigger (source) connection, see Developing Integration Cloud Services, <I>Oracle Cloud Using Oracle Integration Cloud Service</I>.</p>
