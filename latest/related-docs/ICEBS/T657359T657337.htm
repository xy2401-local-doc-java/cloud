service endpoints exposed by the Oracle E-Business Suite of applications. It
provides a complete catalog of Oracle E-Business Suite's business service
interfaces. The tool lets users easily discover and deploy the appropriate
business service interface for integration with any system,
application, or business partner.
  </p><p>The Oracle Integration Repository is shipped as part of the Oracle E-Business Suite.
As your instance is patched, the repository is automatically updated with
content appropriate for the precise revisions of interfaces in your
environment.
  </p><h2>Do Not Use Database Tools to Modify Oracle E-Business Suite Data</h2>
  <p>Oracle STRONGLY RECOMMENDS that you never use SQL*Plus, Oracle Data Browser, database triggers, or any other tool to modify Oracle E-Business Suite data unless otherwise instructed.</p>
  <p>Oracle provides powerful tools you can use to create, store, change, retrieve, and maintain information in an Oracle database. But if you use Oracle tools such as SQL*Plus to modify Oracle E-Business Suite data, you risk destroying the integrity of your data and you lose the ability to audit changes to your data.</p>
  <p>Because Oracle E-Business Suite tables are interrelated, any change you make using an Oracle E-Business Suite form can update many tables at once. But when you modify Oracle E-Business Suite data using anything other than Oracle E-Business Suite, you may change a row in one table without making corresponding changes in related tables. If your tables get out of synchronization with each other, you risk retrieving erroneous information and you risk unpredictable results throughout Oracle E-Business Suite.</p>
  <p>When you use Oracle E-Business Suite to modify your data, Oracle E-Business Suite automatically checks that your changes are valid. Oracle E-Business Suite also keeps track of who changes information. If you enter information into database tables using database tools, you may store invalid information. You also lose the ability to track who has changed your information because SQL*Plus and other database tools do not keep a record of changes.</p>
